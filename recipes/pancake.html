  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p> A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
  </ol>
